                    <p>What is outsourcing? Are there really advantages in outsourcing? Are there any business values?</p>
                    <p>Below are my thoughts and key reasons why company turn to outsourcing. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Let us asks ourselves the following questions:</p>
                    <div class="col-xs-12">
                        <h3>Why do we need to outsource?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the work cost effective?</li>
                            <li>Is the work done with efficiency? </li>
                            <li>Do we have the expertise to do it?</li>
                            <li>Is there other way to effectively and efficiently do it?</li>
                            <li>Can this be done professionally and quickly?</li>
                            <li>How can we cut down on recruitment, training, office supplies and training costs?</li>
                        </ul>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">
                    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                        <h3>What are the advantages of outsourcing?</h3>
                        <h4>1.	I’ll start with cutting costs since this is the popular reason</h4>
                        <p>Expenses on your employees can be categorized to 4 parts. The cost of labor, cost of technology to be used, miscellaneous costs, and management costs. Below is a table of my estimates and please correct me if I’m wrong.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">
                    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                        <p>By releasing these funds, companies can turn fixed costs into variable costs. This is an excellent opportunity for to reallocate these funds to other areas of their business and focusing more on revenue generating activities.</p>
                        <p>Many new start-up businesses and entrepreneurs actually design their operating structure around outsourcing. I for myself outsourced the logo creation in FEVERR which I paid $40, this gave me a good design for the logo, font, business cards, social media and stationary kits. If I was going to do this it will look really unprofessional and Microsoft word-like images. Just like how you see our strategy and status image.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br />
                <div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">
                    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                        <h4>2.	Focus back on core functions of the business</h4>
                        <p>We put emphasis on bringing your focus back on your core functions and strategic profitability initiatives. Separating core from context is essential to the success and growth of any great company. Extract resources from context to invest in the core. Outsourcing will free up your resources and you can use them where it matters the most.</p>
                        <p>For example, if your company offers insurance or is selling a product and you are a team of 2, one is in-charge of marketing and one is in-charge of administrative and clerical tasks. On the first few transactions the paper works will still be manageable and still workable, but when the demand suddenly spike up, who would you rather answer the phone for general inquiries? Data encoding, diary management, answering incoming emails, website and social media maintenance, book keeping, inventory etc..etc…</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">
                    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                        <h4>3.	Increased in efficiency and effectivity</h4>
                        <p>Outsourcing also leads to increased efficiency, because you are entrusting non-central company functions to experts elsewhere. Since we will be specialists in the area of choice, we are intimately familiar with its ins and outs in a way that members your employees couldn’t be without extensive investment and training. This way, the functions you’ve outsourced can be completed both effectively and efficiently by highly-trained experts in the field who are able to implement their skills and knowledge immediately.</p>
                        <p>For example, why do we use xero or myob as part of our accounting process? This takes the burden of mastering complicated accounting duties to you or to your employees. The same concept of outsourcing this non-essentials or back office operation to someone who is highly skilled and highly trained to do those duties who can do it more efficiently and effectively</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">
                    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-1">

                        <h4>4.	Savings on Assets and investments</h4>
                        <p>When you outsource there is no need anymore to spend on developing your infrastructure. When you outsource you are just paying for the service and we will handle all the technology changes to carry the high level of quality we are providing. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">
                    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                        <h4>5.	Cutting expenses on recruitment and training</h4>
                        <p>Again, you don’t need to recruit and train anymore as this is already included on the services that you pay when you choose to outsource. There will be chance that you will be interviewing the agents but this is not mandatory and only if you choose to or specified to us.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">
                    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                        <h4>6.	Flexibility or Scalability of the business</h4>
                        <p>Change is inevitable; the only thing left for businesses to do is to adapt.  When the demand arise our solutions, technologies, facilities and personnel are so flexible. Resources are available to use catering from individuals, small to medium enterprises and we can produce and support up to 3000 agents to any organization that seeks scalability and flexibility that will answer all your organization short-term and long-term future proofing.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">
                    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                        <h4>7.	Talent</h4>
                        <p>Philippines is a strategic place to outsource. It has highly developed business environment and 92% of the Philippines 104 Million people are English speaking. You will have access to an estimate of 450,000 vast pool of skilled and talented graduates each year. The competition is so tough, not only we learned English at a very young age but we are trained to be highly multi-skilled at the same time. You will be surprise that an admin assistant or any person doing blue collar jobs knows how to create website, content writing, graphic designs and the likes. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">
                    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                        <h4>8.	Competent Leaders</h4>
                        <p>We have very competent owners and leaders that will be able to produce multi-skilled team that are capable of dealing more than one task at the same time. They improved efficiency and productivity of our agents. Which will lead to growth and confidence of our teams. </p>
